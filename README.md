# Dotnet Architecture

A small .NET app that I use for learning and experimenting.

## Getting Started

Run `docker compose up -d` to launch the containers for RabbitMQ and Seq. Then just run the project normally.

## Logging

The project is using Seq as logging aggregator.

## Messaging

The project is using NServiceBus with the RabbitMQ transport.
